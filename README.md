## 🏥 Health Monitoring System

### Health Score Calculation
The system calculates a health score (0-100) considering:
- **Test Results (60% weight)**: Pass/fail rates, error counts
- **Maintenance Issues**: Severity-weighted deductions
- **System Status**: Overall health indicators
- **Issue Resolution**: Credit for resolved issues

### Health Score Interpretation
- **90-100**: 🟢 Excellent health
- **70-89**: 🟡 Good health
- **50-69**: 🟠 Fair health (attention needed)
- **0-49**: 🔴 Poor health (immediate action required)

### Automated Recommendations
The system provides intelligent recommendations by mapping failed tests to specific maintenance functions:
- **Critical Issues**: Database connectivity, authentication failures
- **High Priority**: Data consistency, member management issues
- **Medium Priority**: UI components, search functionality
- **Low Priority**: Minor optimizations, cosmetic issues
